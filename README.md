# Unity_Game
This game is a recreation of the one I wrote with SDL2 and Box2D. 
Instead of C++ this is written in C# with the Unity game engine. 

This recreation includes more complex and smooth movement.
As well as teleportation. When you hit your spacebar the character with teleport to your mouse cursors location.

I also implemented simple enemy movement. For tests I just used a plain red square as an ememy.
When you get too close to the enemy it will begin to follow you.
